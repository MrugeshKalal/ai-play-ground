app.js Explanation
==================

This file contains the JavaScript logic for the AI Play Ground app. Hereâ€™s what it does:

1. Listens for a click event on the "Submit" button.
2. When clicked, it reads the value from the input box (the user's prompt).
3. If the input is empty, it displays a message asking the user to enter a prompt.
4. If there is a prompt, it simulates an AI response by calling the `simulateAIResponse` function.
5. The simulated response is displayed in the output area below the input box.
6. The `simulateAIResponse` function simply echoes the user's prompt with a message, mimicking an AI reply.

This setup allows users to interact with the UI and see a simulated AI response without needing a backend or API connection.
